    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let num = 100;
    // let num2 = num;
    // console.log(num2);

    // num = 150;
    // console.log(num2); //logs 100

    //var num2 is assigned the copy value of num.

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const players2 = players;
    console.log(players2);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    players2[0] = 'Denise';
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players2);
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    let players5 = players.slice();
    players5[0] = 'Bruce';
    console.log(players);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let arr = [];
    arr = [].concat(players);
    console.log(arr);

    arr[0] = 'Luca';
    console.log(arr);
    console.log(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let players3 = [...players];
    //console.log(players3);

    // players3[0] = 'David';
    // console.log(players);
    // console.log(players3);

    let newArr = Array.from(players);
    newArr[0] = 'nameless';
    console.log(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    let thatGuy = person;
    thatGuy.name = 'nameless';
    console.log(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    let thisGuy = Object.assign({}, person);
    console.log(thisGuy);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    let obj = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
    obj.number = 99;
    console.log(obj);
    console.log(person);
